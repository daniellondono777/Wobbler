# Wobbler
Wobbler is a concise, modular Linux privilege escalation tool built for speed, precision, and real-world exploitation. Designed to help red teamers, CTF players, and pentesting certification candidates focus on exactly what matters—whether it’s exposed credentials, misconfigured SUID binaries, or exploitable sudo permissions mapped to GTFOBins.
